### Loading h5ad file into R Seurat object

sceasy uses reticulate and thus depends on python environment. Proved to be unstable and hard to use.
SeuratDisk also uses rhdf5, but uses h5-based Seurat format as an intermediate that looks like overcomplication. Additionally, SeuratDisk seems to be almost not supported and it fails even on examples from its own tutorial.
Despite all problems of both packages above they have clear advantage over schard: they allow not only to read h5ad into R but also to write it.

No to seuratdisk as it works with V3 assay and outdated. It also crashes on heavy datasets!
